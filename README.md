# CODSOFT
This Repository Contains the All Project Codes of My Intership Which is in Company Codsoft
There are 5 projects assign by Company and Any 3 Projects Compulsory.

1.CHATBOT WITH RULE-BASED RESPONSE :
 Building a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on
 predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching
 techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate
 responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural
 language processing and conversation flow

2.TIC-TAC-TOE AI :
 Implement an AI agent that plays the classic game of Tic-Tac-Toe
 against a human player. You can use algorithms like Minimax with
 or without Alpha-Beta Pruning to make the AI player unbeatable.
 This project will help you understand game theory and basic search
 algorithms

 3.IMAGE CAPTIONING : 
 Combine computer vision and natural language processing to build
 an image captioning AI. Use pre-trained image recognition models
 like VGG or ResNet to extract features from images, and then use a
 recurrent neural network (RNN) or transformer-based model to
 generate captions for those images.

4.RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM:
 Create a simple recommendation system that suggests items to
 users based on their preferences. You can use techniques like
 collaborative filtering or content-based filtering to recommend
 movies, books, or products to users
 
5.FACE DETECTION AND
 RECOGNITION
